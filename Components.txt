****TOTAL AMOUNT*************

Including both the total of all the financial details and separate totals for each section can be beneficial for users. Here's how you can approach it:

1. Total Income: Provide a summary of the total income from all sources that the user has entered.

2. Total Expenses: Display the total expenses across all categories that the user has provided.

3. Total Savings: Calculate and show the total amount saved or invested based on the user's input.

4. Total Debt: Summarize the total outstanding debt amount across different types of debts.

5. Net Worth: Calculate the net worth by subtracting the total debt from the total assets (such as savings, investments, and property).
